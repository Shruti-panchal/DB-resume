Title : wipro Neural Intelligence Platform
Team Size : 5
Brief: wipro's Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the poer of automation and artificial intelligence
technologies: natural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and
unstructured data sources; an  intent assessment and reasoning  engine that includes sentiment and predictive
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the poer of Deep Machine Learning,
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the ho their queries can be ansered quickly like allL1 activities can be
eliminated.
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU api's and machine learning using
Tensor flo for further learning of ne entities.
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries ith the best
suited response and make the system efficient.
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,
Organizations can be extracted from ra text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities
using Keras TensorFlo frameork.

Migration of data from RDBMS database to Hive (Hadoop ecosystem) . Hadoop platform ability with strong data governance, lineage, auditing and monitoring capabilities. The objective of this project was to speed up the data processing so that the analysis and decision making become easy. Due to RDBMS limitations to process waste amount of data at once and produce the results at the earliest, Client wanted to move the data to Hadoop ecosystem so that they can over-come from those limitations and focus on business improvement only.

Responsibility 1. Optimising the SQL queries for those data which were not required to move from RDBMS to any other platform.
2. Writing the Hive queries and logic to move the data from RDBMS to Hadoop ecosystem.
3. Writing the hive queries to analyse the required data as per the business requirements.
4. Optimization of hive queries in order to increase the performance and minimize the Hadoop resource utilizations.
