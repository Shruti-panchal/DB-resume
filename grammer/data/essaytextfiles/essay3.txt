DEVELOPMENT VS ENVIRONMENT
If we surf the web looking for pollution and environmental catastrophes, we will fi nd out that every country in 
the world suffers them. This is a natural consequence of the struggle between development and environment.
If a country decided to live isolated from the rest of the world, living on what it can naturally grow and 
produce, it surely wouldn’t be highly polluted. But we all want exotic food and technological items from all over 
the world, so we have to pay the price.
Investing on electrical transport would benefi t the environment a lot. Even more if this electricity came 
from a natural source of energy like wind, rivers and solar boards. It’s diffi cult to achieve this because petrol 
companies will fi ght against these actions.
We also have to take care of our rivers and seas. We all have heard about factories throwing highly toxic 
substances to rivers, without minimizing their poisoning effects. A really strict law should be applied to fi ne 
these factories and make them change their policy.
But what about ourselves? We also can do a lot! If, when possible, we bought larger packs of food, we would be 
producing less rubbish. And this is only an example!
