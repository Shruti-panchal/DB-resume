“Life of Buddah”: A Book Review
What would you do if you were born as a prince with all the exclusive fasilities to enjoy this material world? yes, 
most of people will celebrate and enjoy every single right that they have as a son of a king. Beautiful women, 
money, parties and all senses’ gratifi cation stuff. Surprisingly, it didn’t work that way for little Gautama who 
in the future would be a Buddah.
In the book “Life of Buddha”, it is told that Gautama was born as a prince. He got all the facilities to make 
him being comfortable staying in the palace. The king didn’t allow him to get out from the palace for outside of 
the palace is the place of real life happened.
One day, the king asked him to get married but the prince rejected it and decided to leave the palace instead. 
There, he started his spiritual journey and later on had self realization and became a buddha.
This book is suitable for you who like to read about someone’s autobiography and life’s lesson. As a reader I 
can say that I learn a lot from this book. High recommended as something to read before going to bed!
