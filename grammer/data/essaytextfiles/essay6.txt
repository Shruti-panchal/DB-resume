Dear David,
I’m glad your friends are visiting my area soon for a week’s touring holiday. I have many ideas what I can show 
them and tell about.
In my opinion the best way to travel around will be by bike because of small distances between the places and 
views are amazing.
My area includes also beautiful Baltic Sea which many tourist visit especially in summer. Your friends could 
sunbath or swim if they would like but the water is quite cold in this season. Beautiful sightseeing of sunrise is 
the best memorise!
You wrote that they are intrested in history of my local area. That’s great! We have museum of our local 
history where I can go with them. Tickets are not so expensive and I can think about some discount.
What do you think about it? Would you mind send me some your ideas?
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Best wishes,
Sam
