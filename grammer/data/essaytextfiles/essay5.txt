The most useful thing I have ever learned
The most useful thing i have learned is surely speaking English. I’ve been studing English for nine years till now. I 
used to take regular classes in these language which i found very interesting. Also, i learn English in school, my 
teacher is awesome but strict, so i have to study constantly. But most of all, i learn English, watching movies, 
TV shows. Allso cartoons when i was younger. When i came across a movie which was subtitled i turned the 
subtitle off. I enjoy wathing TV and movies on English.
English is the most spoken language across the world. It is studied all over the world. In order to get in 
a conversation with a stranger from other country, you need to speak English. I’m a swimmer, so i go on 
competissions in many countries, and in all of those countries i speak English. I want to study abroad when i 
fi nish highschool, so i’ll defenetly need English. 
All in all, i enjoy speaking it, writing it, and I’m very glad I got to learn it, i fi nd it very useful
