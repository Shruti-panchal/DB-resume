To begin with pollution and damage to the environment is the most serious and difficult problem for countries 
of all over the world. Scientists of different countries predict a global ecocatastrophe if people won’t change 
their attitude to our planet.
First of all a huge damage to the environment brings a transport. People can’t imagine their living without 
cars, buse s, trains, ships and planes. But it’s an open secret that one of disadvantage of these accustomed 
things is harmful exhaust. Needless to say that use of environment friendly engines helps us to save 
atmosphere from pollution.
In addition to this our rivers and seas are in not less danger situation. It’s a fact of common knowledge that 
numerous factories and plants pour off their waste to ponds. Obviously that cleaning manufacturing water 
helps to avoid extinction of ocean residents.
Apart from this I’m inclined to believe that every person can and must contribute to solving this important 
problem. Doing a little steps for protection our environment every day we will be able to save our Earth. And 
it’s a task of each of us.
